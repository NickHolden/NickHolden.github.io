           <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
              Hello! My name is Nick Holden and I am a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan. 
              <br><br>
              I have been passionate about all areas of technology ever since I can remember, but my main interests are in the areas of game development and machine learning. During my time at U of M I hope to be able to take part in some of the undergraduate research programs that are available and eventually pursue a graduate program which allows me to further research my interests!
              <br><br>
              Outside of technology, my hobbies include photography and travelling! I love visiting other cultures and having unique experiences that I would have otherwise never been able to have.
